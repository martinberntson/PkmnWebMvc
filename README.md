# PkmnWebMvc

The scraper is used to get all necessary images from pokemondb.net
They are then used in the MVC to present a list of all pokemon with images.
If I were to make the scraper again, I'd probably use a better way of generating image URLs instead of the one I used for this project.
The scraper follows pokemondb.net's robots.txt requirements, so it'll take several hours to get all images from the site.

Images are not included here due to copyright protection.
